##  What's a Firewall

A firewall can help protect your computer and data by managing your network traffic. 
It does this by blocking unsolicited and unwanted incoming network traffic. A firewall validates access by assessing this incoming traffic for anything malicious like hackers and malware that could infect your computer.

A firewall acts as a gatekeeper. It monitors attempts to gain access to your operating system and blocks unwanted traffic or unrecognized sources.


## Configure whitelist

A whitelist is a list of your trusted inbound and outbound connections. Whitelisting IP addresses is a manual way to ensure that certain IPs have access to or your computer can access to. 
To configure a whitelist you'll need to access to your firewall settings.

You'll need to create a new rule with the IP addresses that you'll allow access to or from.
