##  Biometric access measures


Biometrics are rising as an advanced layer in many personal and enterprise security systems. With unique identifiers of your biology and behaviors like Fingerprint Scanning,Voice Recognition,Iris Recognition and others. This may seem foolproof but, however, biometric identity has made many cautious about its use as standalone authentication.

Modern cybersecurity is focused on reducing the risks for this powerful security solution: traditional passwords have long been a point of weakness for security systems. Biometrics aims to answer this issue by linking proof-of-identity to our bodies and behavior patterns.
Biometric identification has a growing role in our everyday security. Physical characteristics are relatively fixed and individualized — even in the case of twins. Each person’s unique biometric identity can be used to replace or at least augment password systems for computers, phones, and restricted access rooms and buildings.

Once biometric data is obtained and mapped, it is then saved to be matched with future attempts at access. Most of the time, this data is encrypted and stored within the device or in a remote server.



### Most common biometric techniques 

Fingerprint recognition and iris scanning are the most well-known forms of biometric security. However, facial recognition and (finger and palm) vein pattern recognition are also gaining in popularity. 

 - <h2>Fingerprint recognition</h2>

    Identification system based on fingerprint recognition looks for specific characteristics in the line pattern on the surface of the finger.

    <b>The pros</b>
            - Ease of use
            - A robust identification tool
            - Replaces the need to remember multiple passwords 

    <b>The cons</b>
            - Not usable by all
            - System failures may block access



 - <h2>Facial recognition</h2>

    A facial recognition system analyses the shape and position of different parts of the face to determine a match. Surface features, such as the skin, are also sometimes taken into account. 

    <b>The pros</b>
            - Protecting businesses against theft
            - Easy to identifying perpetrators
            - Better security measures

    <b>The cons</b>
            - Greater threat to individual and societal privacy
            - Violates personal rights
            - Provides opportunities for fraud and other crimes



 - <h2>Iris recognition</h2>

    When an iris scan is performed a scanner reads out the unique characteristics of an iris, which are then converted into an encrypted (bar)code. Iris scanning is known to be an excellent biometric security technique, especially if it is performed using infrared light.

    <b>The pros</b>
            - Accuracy and reliability
            - Extremely difficult to be forged
            - It is a secure and cost-effective alternative

    <b>The cons</b>
            - If the subject is unconscious or dead
            - It requires an IR light source and sensor
            - Eyelashes, lenses, and reflections
