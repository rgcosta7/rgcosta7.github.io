## Mitigating the damage of a data breach

Businesses should have a clear strategy on how to deal with a breach, since many experts believe it’s not a matter of if but when one will occur.

You want to have a plan in place before something like this happens, so when an event does happen, you know what to do and how to limit liability as much as possible.

<h2>All employees</h2> should be trained on cybersecurity best practices, from knowing how to spot phishing emails to setting strong passwords and using multi-factor authentication. Also important are frequent backups and offline backups to reinstall files in the event of a ransomware attack.

The two main strategies for devaluing data are encryption and tokenization. Encryption is typically used to secure data in transit, while either encryption or tokenization can be used to secure data stored in systems. Both tactics make data indecipherable to attackers, so even if they access the data in the case of a malware or ransomware attack, they can’t sell it on the black market or commit fraud.

This will allow to take any appropriate action to prevent any further damage.


<h2>2- Assess the risks</h2>
