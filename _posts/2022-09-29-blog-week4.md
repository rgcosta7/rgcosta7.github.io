# **Outcome 2 - Use data security tools for personal devices**

## The use of a Firewall to protect their personal PC


A firewall regulates connections between devices on your local network, the LAN, and the outside world. When you browse the internet or use a VOIP program like Skype to make a call, your computer communicates with the Wide Area Network (WAN) by exchanging packets of information over designated ports; these differ according to the application type. These packets travel both from the outside network to the computers on the LAN during the downlink (such as when you’re downloading a file from the internet), and in the opposite direction during the uplink (such as when you’re uploading a video to YouTube).


Firewalls software used to prevent unauthorized access to your computer network.
They can be used by both individuals and large businesses to filter the information going in and out of your computer via the internet. If the firewall filter catches anything suspicious, it denies it access to your computer system and private network.

They are vital for stopping dangerous or fraudulent traffic from accessing your network. They block specific programs from accessing the internet if the activity is deemed too risky.

In this day and age, every computer needs a firewall in order to protect sensitive data. The question is whether a firewall alone is enough to fully protect your PC.


## **Windows Defender (Firewall)**

Windows Defender it's a FREE software firewall that comes with Windows and it's light on system resources.
This firewall monitors inbound and outbound network traffic, blocking any suspicious connections it finds and immediately notification pop-ups for blocked content




 ## How configure the Firewall to add or remove allowed programs or ports.


Here’s how to find and configure the settings that allow approved programs and connections. We used Windows Defender’s firewall for Windows 10 as an example:

- Open Settings
- Select “Firewall & network protection” from “Windows Security”
- Click “Allow an app through firewall”

On the following window, find the affected programs on the list and allow connections through either Private or Public networks
You can decide which online connections are private or public networks when you connect to a new hotspot. In general, public networks are reserved for coffee shop Wi-Fi networks and other public areas. Private networks are for your home or work connections.
