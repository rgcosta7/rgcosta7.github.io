## Data backup: Why it’s important plus strategies to protect your information

### **What is a data backup?**

A data backup is a copy or archive of the important information stored on your devices such as a computer, phone, or tablet, and it’s used to restore that original information in the event of a data loss.

Data losses can occur in many forms, from hard drive failures to ransomware attacks and even human error or physical theft. No matter the misfortune, a data backup could be the respite you’re looking for to restore the data stored on your devices. It’s typically stored in a secure, separate location from an original device, such as a cloud.

This way,  whenever you have that crushing feeling that all your hard work and treasured memories are gone, you can rest assured that a data backup has your back.



### **Data backup solutions and backup storage options**

In choosing a data backup solution, individuals can take cues from how businesses develop their own data backup strategies and do this by considering the recovery point objectives.

At the end of the day, the best data backup solution is one that suits your needs — and that’s different for everyone. For this reason, you also might want to consider:

- Ease of set up
- Cost
- Storage space
- The security of your data
- How quickly your data can be backed up
- Ease of access to your data backup

**1. Removable media: The smallest storage**
Generally refers to small portable devices mostly used to transfer files from device to device. This includes CDs, DVDs, and USB flash drives, also called pen drives, thumb drives, or jump drives, all of which are compatible with laptop and desktop computers.

Their size is an indication of their storage capacity, with some supporting as little as 128MB but others capable of storing up to 256 GB.

**2. External hard drives: Ample storage**
an external hard drive is connected to the computer or laptop on the outside via cables or wirelessly. Examples of external hard drives can include USB flash drives and solid-state drives, also known as SSDs.

Like removable media, external hard drives are portable and easy to use, but they’re capable of storing larger files — anywhere from 128 GB to 10 TB.  They are most compatible with computers and laptops.

**3. Cloud backup: Flexible storage**
Cloud backups allows users to back up their data to hardware that’s in a remote location. Users can access and manage their data anytime on any device via the internet.

Some common cloud storage solutions you probably already use include iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox*, all of which are compatible with cell phones, tablets, desktop computers, and laptops.

**4. Backup services: The most storage**
This method of data backup is similar to that of a backup administrator in a business, meaning you’re putting a person or service in charge of your data backups because they have access to robust backup softwares, hardware appliances, or even hybrid data backup solutions.

### Data backup guidelines

There are a lot of options when it comes to backing up your data, each with its own procedures and parameters. Still, there’s one rule of thumb—and a few best practices—that apply to any data backup.

- **#1: Back up regularly**
The longer the span of time you leave between your data backups, the more data you might lose. So, back up regularly and often.

- **#2: Always opt for more storage**
You might save a few pennies by only storing what you absolutely can’t replace. But data storage can be cheap, consider what data storage options make the most sense with which data. For instance, if your house is flooded, a physical data backup like removable media might be lost. But data that’s backed up on the cloud will not, so you might want to consider storing your irreplaceable information there.

In the end, you don’t have to pick between a physical data backup and backing up in the cloud.

Choosing both is your safest bet because the more places your data is backed up, the better.

- **#3:  Don’t underestimate physical copies**
our documents are likely the most important part of your data backup. So take time to organize them. That way, you can be confident you’ve backed up everything you need.
hey should provide peace of mind that you’ve done all you can to safeguard your important information and treasured memories against life’s unknowns.
