With unique identifiers of your biology and behaviors like Fingerprint Scanning,Voice Recognition,Iris Recognition and others. This may seem foolproof but, however, biometric identity has made many cautious about its use as standalone authentication.Modern cybersecurity is focused on reducing the risks for this powerful security solution: traditional passwords have long been a point of weakness for security systems. Biometrics aims to answer this issue by linking proof-of-identity to our bodies and behavior patterns.Biometric identification has a growing role in our everyday security. Physical characteristics are relatively fixed and individualized — even in the case of twins. Each person’s unique biometric identity can be used to replace or at least augment password systems for computers, phones, and restricted access rooms and buildings.Once biometric data is obtained and mapped, it is then saved to be matched with future attempts at access. Most of the time, this data is encrypted and stored within the device or in a remote server.Most common biometric techniquesFingerprint recognition and iris scanning are the most well-known forms of biometric security. However, facial recognition and (finger and palm) vein pattern recognition are also gaining in popularity. Fingerprint recognition Identification system based on fingerprint recognition looks for specific characteristics in the line pattern on the surface of the finger. The pros - Ease of use - A robust identification tool - Replaces the need to remember multiple passwords The cons - Not usable by all - System failures may block access Facial recognition A facial recognition system analyses the shape and position of different parts of the face to determine a match. Surface features, such as the skin, are also sometimes taken into account. The pros - Protecting businesses against theft - Easy to identifying perpetrators - Better security measures The cons - Greater threat to individual and societal privacy - Violates personal rights - Provides opportunities for fraud and other crimes Iris recognition When an iris scan is performed a scanner reads out the unique characteristics of an iris, which are then converted into an encrypted (bar)code. Iris scanning is known to be an excellent biometric security technique, especially if it is performed using infrared light. The pros - Accuracy and reliability - Extremely difficult to be forged - It is a secure and cost-effective alternative The cons - If the subject is unconscious or dead - It requires an IR light source and sensor - Eyelashes, lenses, and reflections Cyber Security for IT Professionals courseI enrol in the above course by Malcolm Shore and complete it, was a fun course to do and I learn so much.

Physical security risks can include: Internal: Internal threats can include unstable power supply, fire, or other risks like humidity in the hardware room. External: External security threats include floods, lightning, and earthquakes. Human: Human threats can include vandalism or theft of hardware or infrastructure, intentional or accidental errors, and disruption.TailgatingTailgating occurs when an unauthorised person follows an authorised person into a restricted area. It can simply occur as people are passing through doors and only those at the front have to swipe a card or present identification. Those at the back can simply follow-through, making it easy for unauthorised persons to gain access without difficulty.Solution An access control system tailored to your entry points security needs can help you control how you grant and restrict access to your business premises. You can control how visitors and personnel access areas, create permissions, limit access with time schedules, and receive reports about which visitors of staff access which areas and at what times.VandalismVandalism is the intentional damage, defacement, or destruction of someone’s property without the owner’s consent. In some cases, it can cripple your business and significantly drain your resources.SolutionA CCTV security solution can help reduce vandalism risk by alerting you when unknown people or vehicles arrive on your business premises.Social engineeringSocial engineering mainly involves manipulating your employees, and this can be through information gained from impersonation or taking advantage of basic human empathy to access secure networks and areas.SolutionAgain, an effective access control system can help combat such risks by simplifying how you grant or restrict access to your business premises. Having a security officer at all entry points can ensure you verify who gains access and why.Raising security awareness among your employees is also vital while incorporating security policies like not holding doors for people they don’t know.TheftYour company can face risks of different kinds of theft, including theft of valuable data and equipment, sensitive information, identity theft, credit card theft, or theft of documents.SolutionAlarm systems can help you detect, CCTV systems can help assess the situation, and security personnel can respond and intervene to stop the criminal or intruder from reaching their target." }, { "title": "Outcome 3 - Damage Mitigation and Whitelisting v Blacklisting - Week 8", "url": "/posts/blog-week8/", "categories": "Data Security, Week 8, Damage Mitigation", "tags": "backups, data security, data recovery, backup, whitelisting, blacklisting", "date": "2022-11-07 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Mitigating the damage of a data breachBusinesses should have a clear strategy on how to deal with a breach, since many experts believe it’s not a matter of if but when one will occur.You want to have a plan in place before something like this happens, so when an event does happen, you know what to do and how to limit liability as much as possible.All employees, should be trained on cybersecurity best practices, from knowing how to spot phishing emails to setting strong passwords and using multi-factor authentication. Also important are frequent backups and offline backups to reinstall files in the event of a ransomware attack.The two main strategies for devaluing data are encryption and tokenization. Encryption is typically used to secure data in transit, while either encryption or tokenization can be used to secure data stored in systems. Both tactics make data indecipherable to attackers, so even if they access the data in the case of a malware or ransomware attack, they can’t sell it on the black market or commit fraud.How to recover from a data breachContain the breachAs soon the breach is detected, there’s the need to identify how the incident happened. This will allow to take any appropriate action to prevent any further damage.Assess the risksAs soon the threat has been contained, the extent of the damage and how to proceed should be discussed.They relevant details should be found: What type of data is involved How sensitive the data is; Approximately how many people’s data is affected. Who is affected (customers, staff, suppliers, etc.) Whether the information contains financial information or other high-risk data; Whether the stolen data is encrypted; and Whether the organisation backed up the data.Notify regulatorsUnder the GDPR, data breaches that is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, it doesn’t need to be reported to the ICO. Furthermore, it tells us we should inform affected individuals only where it is likely to result in a high risk.Prepare for the futureAfter responded to an incident, the appropriate action should be taken to prevent future breaches.This might include investing in better security technology, updating its policies or making its staff more aware of their cyber security responsibilities.Whitelist and BlacklistWhat Is Blacklisting?The blacklisting approach involves defining which entities should be blocked. A blacklist is a list of suspicious or malicious entities that should be denied access or running rights on a network or system.The blacklist approach is threat-centric, and the default is to allow access. Any entity not on the blacklist is granted access, but anything that’s known or expected to be a threat is blocked.When to Use BlacklistingBlacklisting is the right choice if you want to make it easy for users to access your systems, and you want to minimize administrative effort. If you value those things more than having the most stringent access control possible, choose blacklisting.What Is Whitelisting?Whitelisting tackles the same challenges as blacklisting but uses the opposite approach. Instead of creating a list of threats, you create a list of permitted entities and block everything else. To create a whitelist for the network level, you need to consider all of the tasks that users need to perform and the tools they’ll need to complete them.When to Use WhitelistingIf, on the other hand, you want to maximize security and don’t mind the extra administrative effort or limited accessibility, whitelisting is the best choice. Whitelisting is ideal when stringent access control and security are crucial." }, { "title": "Outcome 3 - Backup Strategies - Week 7", "url": "/posts/blog-week7/", "categories": "Data Security, Week 7, Firewall", "tags": "backups, data security, data recovery, backup", "date": "2022-10-22 00:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "Data backup: Why it’s important plus strategies to protect your informationWhat is a data backup?A data backup is a copy or archive of the important information stored on your devices such as a computer, phone, or tablet, and it’s used to restore that original information in the event of a data loss.Data losses can occur in many forms, from hard drive failures to ransomware attacks and even human error or physical theft. No matter the misfortune, a data backup could be the respite you’re looking for to restore the data stored on your devices. It’s typically stored in a secure, separate location from an original device, such as a cloud.This way, whenever you have that crushing feeling that all your hard work and treasured memories are gone, you can rest assured that a data backup has your back.Data backup solutions and backup storage optionsIn choosing a data backup solution, individuals can take cues from how businesses develop their own data backup strategies and do this by considering the recovery point objectives.At the end of the day, the best data backup solution is one that suits your needs — and that’s different for everyone. For this reason, you also might want to consider: Ease of set up Cost Storage space The security of your data How quickly your data can be backed up Ease of access to your data backup1. Removable media: The smallest storageGenerally refers to small portable devices mostly used to transfer files from device to device. This includes CDs, DVDs, and USB flash drives, also called pen drives, thumb drives, or jump drives, all of which are compatible with laptop and desktop computers.Their size is an indication of their storage capacity, with some supporting as little as 128MB but others capable of storing up to 256 GB.2. External hard drives: Ample storagean external hard drive is connected to the computer or laptop on the outside via cables or wirelessly. Examples of external hard drives can include USB flash drives and solid-state drives, also known as SSDs.Like removable media, external hard drives are portable and easy to use, but they’re capable of storing larger files — anywhere from 128 GB to 10 TB. They are most compatible with computers and laptops.3. Cloud backup: Flexible storageCloud backups allows users to back up their data to hardware that’s in a remote location. Users can access and manage their data anytime on any device via the internet.Some common cloud storage solutions you probably already use include iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox*, all of which are compatible with cell phones, tablets, desktop computers, and laptops.4. Backup services: The most storageThis method of data backup is similar to that of a backup administrator in a business, meaning you’re putting a person or service in charge of your data backups because they have access to robust backup softwares, hardware appliances, or even hybrid data backup solutions.Data backup guidelinesThere are a lot of options when it comes to backing up your data, each with its own procedures and parameters. Still, there’s one rule of thumb—and a few best practices—that apply to any data backup. #1: Back up regularlyThe longer the span of time you leave between your data backups, the more data you might lose. So, back up regularly and often. #2: Always opt for more storageYou might save a few pennies by only storing what you absolutely can’t replace. But data storage can be cheap, consider what data storage options make the most sense with which data. For instance, if your house is flooded, a physical data backup like removable media might be lost. But data that’s backed up on the cloud will not, so you might want to consider storing your irreplaceable information there. In the end, you don’t have to pick between a physical data backup and backing up in the cloud.Choosing both is your safest bet because the more places your data is backed up, the better. #3: Don’t underestimate physical copiesour documents are likely the most important part of your data backup. So take time to organize them. That way, you can be confident you’ve backed up everything you need.hey should provide peace of mind that you’ve done all you can to safeguard your important information and treasured memories against life’s unknowns.Common deleted files recovery methods. Allways Check Your Recycle Bin Use OS Search Bar Use a Data Recovery Software EaseUS It offers support for both Mac and PC users, and can even recover files on mobile devices.

IDSes can be either network- or host-based. A host-based intrusion detection system is installed on the client computer, while a network-based intrusion detection system resides on the network.An IDS may be implemented as a software application running on customer hardware or as a network security appliance. Cloud-based intrusion detection systems are also available to protect data and systems in cloud deployments.Different types of intrusion detection systems NIDS - A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is deployed at a strategic point or points within the network, where it can monitor inbound and outbound traffic to and from all the devices on the network. HIDS - A host intrusion detection system (HIDS) runs on all computers or devices in the network with direct access to both the internet and the enterprise’s internal network. A HIDS has an advantage over an NIDS in that it may be able to detect anomalous network packets that originate from inside the organization or malicious traffic that an NIDS has failed to detect. A HIDS may also be able to identify malicious traffic that originates from the host itself, such as when the host has been infected with malware and is attempting to spread to other systems. Access controls and AuditingBoth are very important to protect your computer systems.Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach. They apply anywhere access is required to perform a business activity and should be adhered to when accessing information in any format, on any device.For the other side, Auditing helps ensure that policies, procedures, and regulations are carried out in a manner consistent with organizational standards." }, { "title": "Outcome 2 - Use data security tools for personal devices. - Week 4", "url": "/posts/blog-week4/", "categories": "Data Security, Week 4, Firewalls", "tags": "data, breach, security", "date": "2022-10-01 00:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "The use of a Firewall to protect their personal PCA firewall regulates connections between devices on your local network, the LAN, and the outside world. When you browse the internet or use a VOIP program like Skype to make a call, your computer communicates with the Wide Area Network (WAN) by exchanging packets of information over designated ports; these differ according to the application type. These packets travel both from the outside network to the computers on the LAN during the downlink (such as when you’re downloading a file from the internet), and in the opposite direction during the uplink (such as when you’re uploading a video to YouTube).Firewalls software used to prevent unauthorized access to your computer network.They can be used by both individuals and large businesses to filter the information going in and out of your computer via the internet. If the firewall filter catches anything suspicious, it denies it access to your computer system and private network.They are vital for stopping dangerous or fraudulent traffic from accessing your network.

The consequences for victims of these break-ins can include the loss of valuable data such as presentations, emails, and music. Victims may also have their bank account information, money, or even their identity stolen. Moreover, unauthorized users may use someone else’s computer to break the law, which could put the victim in legal trouble.One of the most common ways that hackers break into computers is by guessing passwords. Simple and commonly used passwords enable intruders to easily gain access and control of a computing device.Conversely, a password that is difficult to guess makes it prohibitively difficult for common hackers to break into a machine and will force them to look for another target. The more difficult the password, the lower the likelihood that one’s computer will fall victim to an unwanted intrusion.How to create a strong password in 7 steps:1. MAKE YOUR PASSWORD LONG.The longer and more complex your password is, the longer this process takes. Passwords that are three characters long take less than a second to crack.2. MAKE YOUR PASSWORD A NONSENSE PHRASE.If your letter combinations are not in the dictionary, your phrases are not in published literature, and none of it is grammatically correct, they will be harder to crack. Also do not use characters that are sequential on a keyboard such as numbers in order or the widely used “qwerty.”3. INCLUDE NUMBERS, SYMBOLS, AND UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE LETTERS.Randomly mix up symbols and numbers with letters. You could substitute a zero for the letter O or @ for the letter A, for example. If your password is a phrase, consider capitalizing the first letter of each new word, which will be easier for you to remember.4. AVOID USING OBVIOUS PERSONAL INFORMATION.If there is information about you that is easily discoverable—such as your birthday, anniversary, address, city of birth, high school, and relatives’ and pets’ names—do not include them in your password. These only make your password easier to guess.5. DO NOT REUSE PASSWORDS.If your account is compromised and you use this email address and password combination across multiple sites, your information can be easily used to get into any of these other accounts. Use unique passwords for everything.6. START USING A PASSWORD MANAGER.Password managers are services that auto-generate and store strong passwords on your behalf. These passwords are kept in an encrypted, centralized location, which you can access with a master password.7. CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS REGULARLY.The more sensitive your information is, the more often you should change your password. Once it is changed, do not use that password again for a very long time.Example of a strong password and how long will take to be hackedh0m£r$imp$0nEncryption for sensitive dataEncryption is important to every business today because it enables them to protect confidential data by converting it into ciphertext, a form that is unreadable without an encryption key. This process is called “encoding.” Encryption makes it nearly impossible for cybercriminals or other unauthorized parties to steal and misuse the data since only those with an encryption key can decipher the data and reveal the true information.The importance of encryption cannot be understated in the slightest because even the biggest corporations with the largest cybersecurity budgets fall victim to data breaches. That being said, even if your data is in a secure infrastructure, there is still a chance that your data could be compromised. With data encryption, however, your files can be that much more impenetrable even if they were stolen." }, { "title": "Outcome 1 - Explain the causes and effects of data security breaches. - Week 2", "url": "/posts/blog-week2/", "categories": "Data Security, Week 2, Data Breach", "tags": "data, breach, security", "date": "2022-09-14 00:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "Outcome 1 - Data breachRecent reported data breachLarge-scale cyber security breaches often make the headlines but about 70% of organisations are keeping their worse security incidents hidden from the public.One of recent data breach made public in August 2021 was T-MobileT-Mobile was hacked back in August 2021 by a 21-year-old hacker by the name of John Binns,According to the Wall Street Journal, he had been searching for gaps in T-Mobile’s defenses through its internet addresses and gained access to the T-Mobile network through an unprotected router in July and that lead to a data center near East Wenatchee, Washington, where he could explore more than 100 of the company’s servers. From there, it took about one week to gain access to the servers that contained the personal data of millions. By August 4, he had stolen millions of files.T-Mobile never respond to requests for comment but released a statement later that confirming that the names, dates of birth, SSNs, driver’s licenses, phone numbers, as well as IMEI and IMSI information for about 7.8 million customers had been stolen in the breach.Another 40 million former or prospective customers had their names, dates of birth, SSNs and driver’s licenses leaked. More than 5 million “current postpaid customer accounts” also had information like names, addresses, date of births, phone numbers, IMEIs and IMSIs illegally accessed.From what’s been told by the hacker, this could be prevented by using more modern equipment and better security measures.The lawsuit against T-MobileT-Mobile has agreed to a settlement totaling $500 million in a class-action lawsuit filed by customers after the company disclosed in August 2021 that sensitive data had been breached in a cyberattack.In a court, the mobile phone giant said it would pay $350 million to settle the customers’ claims and spend $150 million over the next few years bolstering its cybersecurity protection and technologies.The breach affected 76.6 million people in the United States, according to the company.

Additional fines will vary depending but may come from both regulatory agencies and card network brands.Forensic investigationsOne of the consequences of a data breach is that the business that was attacked will be responsible for performing a forensic investigation in order to determine the causes of the data breach. These investigations often yield valuable evidence and insights that help prevent future data breaches. In the short term, however, these investigations can be costly.Future security costsBusinesses that are the victim of a data breach may incur costs related to mandatory credit monitoring for customers whose data was compromised.

I found this GitHub page from MichaelTrip, a big thanks to him!!1 - Download the patched kernelAt the shell:mkdir iommu &amp;&amp; cd iommuand download the patched kernel:wget https://github.com/MichaelTrip/relax-intel-rmrr/releases/download/v1.0.8/linux-tools-5.13-dbgsym_5.13.19-4_amd64.debwget https://github.com/MichaelTrip/relax-intel-rmrr/releases/download/v1.0.8/linux-tools-5.13_5.13.19-4_amd64.debwget https://github.com/MichaelTrip/relax-intel-rmrr/releases/download/v1.0.8/pve-headers-5.13.19-2-pve-relaxablermrr_5.13.19-4_amd64.debwget https://github.com/MichaelTrip/relax-intel-rmrr/releases/download/v1.0.8/pve-kernel-5.13.19-2-pve-relaxablermrr_5.13.19-4_amd64.debwget https://github.com/MichaelTrip/relax-intel-rmrr/releases/download/v1.0.8/pve-kernel-libc-dev_5.13.19-4_amd64.debInstall the kernek,dpkg -i *.deb2 - Set the kernel as defaultFind the new kernel IDs,grep menu /boot/grub/grub.cfgFrom the previus output you will need to find the submenu option ID, something like this gnulinux-advanced-83ea5c69-120d-4ba6-8d91-e3de2dc98b0a and the relaxablermrr gnulinux-5.13.19-2-pve-relaxablermrr-advanced-83ea5c69-120d-4ba6-8d91-e3de2dc98b0aCopy both from your output, you’ll need it to set them as a default kernel in each boot.Edit grub,nano /etc/default/grubOn the GRUB_DEFAULT you need to paste the IDs that you copy early in this format:GRUB_DEFAULT=\"SUBMENU_ID&gt;MENUENTRY_ID\"You’ll need to add intel_iommu=on,relax_rmrr iommu=pt to the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet\" to look like this,GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet intel_iommu=on,relax_rmrr iommu=pt\"3 - Load the neccessary modulesEdit /etc/modules and add to the end:vfiovfio_iommu_type1vfio_pcivfio_virqfdAnd to finish, one last option need to be add:echo \"options vfio_iommu_type1 allow_unsafe_interrupts=1\" &gt; /etc/modprobe.d/iommu_unsafe_interrupts.confNow you can reboot, finger crossed that all was done right,shutdown -r nowAfter boot you can confir wich kernel you using by typing,uname -rYou should get 5.13.19-2-pve-relaxablermrr at the time I was writing this page.And you can check if IOMMU was loaded,dmesg | grep 'Intel-IOMMU'Expand local volume (merge all the volumes)On the proxmox webgui go to Datacenter --&gt; Storage select local-lvm and remove it!Go to proxmox shell and,lvremove /dev/pve/datalvresize -l +100%FREE /dev/pve/rootresize2fs /dev/mapper/pve-root This should it, you can see that now you just have local and all the free space is in local.Again, go to Datacenter --&gt; Storage and edit local to be use for all the purpose, ‘Disk image’, ‘ISO image’…all of them in my case!Container TemplatesIf is missing some templates from the list, special the TurnKey you’ll need to run the follow command on the shell:pveam updateNetworkNIC TEAM (LACP)To enable port bound on a network just edit interfaces file and add the follow lines:nano /etc/network/interfacesauto bond0iface bond0 inet manual \tbond-slaves enp3s0f0 enp3s0f1 bond-miimon 100 bond-mode 802.3ad bond-xmit-hash-policy layer2+3NOTE: bond-slaves are the name of the both ports you want to bond, you’ll need to look for the names that your system are using.VLANSYou can make a interfaces vlan aware just by adding the last 2 lines of code to the interfaces file:nano /etc/network/interfacesauto vmbr0iface vmbr0 inet static \taddress 172.31.12.99/24 gateway 172.31.12.254 bridge-ports bond0 bridge-stp off bridge-fd 0 bridge-vlan-aware yes bridge-vids 2-4094For a more complex VLAN setup you can create a Linux VLAN and then create a Linux Brigde to that VLAN.When create a VM or a container you can pick what bridge you want to give to the VM/Container.nano /etc/network/interfacesExample:auto enp3s0f2.50iface enp3s0f2.50 inet manual#This is VLAN 50 for ADMINauto vmbr0iface vmbr0 inet static address 172.31.50.99/24 gateway 172.31.50.190 bridge-ports enp3s0f2.50 bridge-stp off bridge-fd 0#This is VLAN 50 for ADMINThis way you don’t need to tell the Bridge about the VLANSPS: MAKE SURE YOUR SWITCH ARE PROPERLY SETUP FOR VLANSRestart the networksystemctl restart networking.service" } ]
